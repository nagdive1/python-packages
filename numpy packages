What is NumPy?
NumPy is a general-purpose array-processing package. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays.'''
# Python program to demonstrate 
# basic array characteristics 
import numpy as np 

# Creating array object 
arr = np.array( [[ 1, 2, 3], 
				[ 4, 2, 5]] ) 

# Printing type of arr object 
print("Array is of type: ", type(arr)) 

# Printing array dimensions (axes) 
print("No. of dimensions: ", arr.ndim) 

# Printing shape of array 
print("Shape of array: ", arr.shape) 

# Printing size (total number of elements) of array 
print("Size of array: ", arr.size) 

# Printing type of elements in array 
print("Array stores elements of type: ", arr.dtype)
